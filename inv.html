                            <strong>Abstract: </strong>As an important medium for information propagation, the study of
                            public opinion propagation mechanism on social networks can help people deeply understand
                            the whole process of the outbreak, diffusion and extinction of public opinion events, s
                            thereby significantly enhancing the governance ability of governments and enterprises
                            against false or undesirable content. In the real world, the spread of public opinion events
                            is profoundly influenced by the intricate public opinion environment. Within the complex
                            public opinion environment, multifaceted factors such as user social relationships,
                            individual preferences, characteristics of public opinion events, pivotal users, sphere
                            effects, and various complex public opinion field effects collectively affect the
                            propagation process of public opinion events. In this talk, we introduce our recent studies
                            on predicting the public opinion event propagation of large social networks under the
                            complex public opinion field environment. These studies mainly encompass three aspects:
                            inference of users' propagation preference, propagation model of public opinion events based
                            on the sphere effect, and analysis and prediction of the propagation of public opinion
                            events under the effect of complex public opinion field. These studies can achieve accurate
                            prediction of public opinion propagation in complex public opinion field environments.

                            <strong>Abstract: </strong>The current mainstream knowledge graph reasoning method is
                            induction oriented statistical reasoning, which starts from data and predicts potential
                            relationships in the knowledge graph based on statistical models. It is mainly divided into
                            end-to-end statistical reasoning and interpretable statistical reasoning. In the era of
                            large language models, how to use external parameterized knowledge rich in textual semantics
                            to support end-to-end statistical reasoning and interpretable statistical reasoning is a
                            research direction worth exploring. Therefore, this talk will introduce the cutting-edge
                            work of knowledge graph reasoning based on large language model, and discuss the relevant
                            difficulties and challenges from the perspectives of deterministic knowledge graph and
                            uncertain knowledge graph.
